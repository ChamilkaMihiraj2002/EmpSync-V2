# Receipt Printing Updates - Multiple Orders Support

## Overview
Updated the order placement and receipt printing system to handle multiple orders correctly. When a user selects meals across different meal times and dates, the system now:

1. **Sends separate orders to database** (one per meal time/date combination)
2. **Prints separate receipts** (one per order with correct barcode)
3. **Uses correct dates and times** for each receipt

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Order Processing (`placeOrder` function)
- **Added `orderItems` tracking**: Each grouped order now stores its specific items
- **Added `orderResponses` array**: Stores all successful order responses for printing
- **Sequential receipt printing**: Prints separate receipts for each order with delays

```javascript
// Before: Only stored last order response
let lastOrderResponse = null;

// After: Store all order responses with their items
const orderResponses = [];
orderResponses.push({
  orderResponse: response.data,
  orderItems: groupedOrders[key].orderItems,
  mealTime: mealTime,
  orderDate: orderDate
});
```

### 2. Enhanced Receipt Printing (`printOrderReceipt` function)
- **Added parameters**: `mealTime` and `orderDate` for accurate receipt data
- **Filtered items**: Only prints items belonging to the specific order
- **Correct dates**: Uses actual order date from database + current system time
- **Improved notifications**: Shows which meal type receipt was printed

```javascript
// Before: Used selectedMealTime and calculated dates
const mealTypeName = availableMealTimes.find(m => m.id === selectedMealTime)?.name;
orderDate: selectedDate === "today" ? new Date().toLocaleDateString('en-IN') : ...

// After: Uses specific order data
const mealTypeName = availableMealTimes.find(m => m.id === mealTime)?.name;
orderDate: orderDate ? new Date(orderDate).toLocaleDateString('en-IN') : ...
```

## Example Scenario

**User selects:**
- 2 meals for Breakfast today
- 1 meal for Dinner today  
- 3 meals for Lunch tomorrow

**System behavior:**

### Database
✅ Creates **3 separate orders** in database:
1. Order #1: Breakfast today (2 meals)
2. Order #2: Dinner today (1 meal)
3. Order #3: Lunch tomorrow (3 meals)

### Receipt Printing
✅ Prints **3 separate receipts**:
1. **Receipt #1**: Breakfast order with barcode for Order #1
   - Date: Today's date (from database)
   - Time: Current print time
   - Items: Only the 2 breakfast meals
   
2. **Receipt #2**: Dinner order with barcode for Order #2
   - Date: Today's date (from database)
   - Time: Current print time
   - Items: Only the 1 dinner meal
   
3. **Receipt #3**: Lunch order with barcode for Order #3
   - Date: Tomorrow's date (from database)
   - Time: Current print time
   - Items: Only the 3 lunch meals

## Technical Features

### Receipt Content
- **Order ID**: Unique barcode for each order
- **Employee Name**: From user session
- **Order Date**: Actual date from database order record
- **Print Time**: Current system time when receipt is printed
- **Meal Type**: Specific meal time (Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner)
- **Items**: Only items belonging to that specific order
- **Total**: Calculated total for that specific order

### Barcode Generation
- Each receipt has a **unique barcode** corresponding to its Order ID
- Barcodes are **extra large** (120x5) for easy scanning
- Uses **CODE128** format for thermal printer compatibility

### Error Handling
- **Individual receipt failure**: If one receipt fails, others still print
- **Printer connection**: Auto-reconnect if needed
- **Detailed notifications**: Shows success/failure for each receipt

## User Experience

1. **Place Order**: User clicks "Place Order" button
2. **Success Message**: Shows order success
3. **Receipt Printing**: Automatically prints all receipts sequentially
4. **Progress Notifications**: Shows when each receipt is printed
5. **Final Confirmation**: Confirms all receipts printed successfully

## Benefits

✅ **Accurate Order Tracking**: Each meal time gets its own order ID and barcode  
✅ **Kitchen Efficiency**: Staff can scan specific barcodes for specific meal times  
✅ **Audit Trail**: Clear separation between different meal orders  
✅ **Date Accuracy**: Receipts show correct order dates from database  
✅ **Time Accuracy**: Print time shows when receipt was actually generated  

This update ensures that the receipt printing system accurately reflects the multi-order database structure and provides proper tracking for meal service operations.
